Handling missing data is a crucial step in data preprocessing because missing values can negatively impact the performance of Machine Learning models. Here are common techniques to handle missing data:

1. Removing Missing Data
2. Imputation (Filling Missing Data)
Mean/Median/Mode Imputation
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Imputation
